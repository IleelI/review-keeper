## Installation

To use Remix Standard, you need to have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and PNPM installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Install Node.js:**

   If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Or even better use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-bash/nvm)

2. (Optional) **Install PNPM:**
   Package manager is purly optional choice, but I recommend PNPM as it gives you speed and great UX while developing your next great application.
